TODO: actually, to tell â€¦

**_Spoiler alert:_** no happy ending here.

Once upon a time, there was a little pig.
He was born and raised in a crowded farm.
His parents work hard to provide him and his sister with food.
But the price for food is that, his parents aren't around when they are around.
Fortunately, little pig has many close friends and relatives besides him.
They take him in, play with him, take care of him.
But when the sun goes down, his friends and relatives go back to their home.
The little pig realizes their home isn't his home.
He goes back to his house.
But his doesn't feel like a home.

Little pig doesn't really know what it's like to love someone or to be loved.
He watches people around him falling in love, taking care of others, hurting others in the name of love, and also falling out of love.
Regardless, he has a bit of knowledge here and there about how to take care of himself and others.
However, he wasn't really taught properly how to receive love and how to love himself and others.

As the pig grows older, one day, he leave everything behind, his old house, close friends and relatives, and goes out into the world.
He makes new friends along the way.
Many teach him invaluable lessons about life.
The little pig himself learns one sad truth about life itself: friends come and go.
People has come and gone all his life.
He soon realizes that he himself also come in and go out of other's lives.
Like it or not, it's just the nature of our lives.
It's sad sometimes, _"how easy it is in life to part ways with people forever"_.
No matter how meaningful [these small hours, these little wonders](https://youtu.be/q6wZhd8M848?si=wcmVIaEgzVBqPIh-) are, they already start to fade away.

On another side of the world, there was an adorable little princess.
The kingdom was small and faced many struggles.
But the king and queen gave their children the best of what they can, and taught them all that they know about life.
Time flies by.
Under the nurture of the king and queen, the princess grows up and becomes a beautiful, smart, kind, and brave lady.

> Coincidence is a remarkable concurrence of events or circumstances that have no apparent causal connection with one another. - Wikipedia :)

Once a while, fate has brought about a rare coincidence: their lives crossed path on a summer day.

To her, he was the light in the end of the tunnel.
Little does she know, to him, she was the light shining from up high.

Life hasn't been easy to both of them.
Life pushes them down again and again.
Their hearts are full of scars.

There were times that the pig felt like he was sitting in a dark, bottomless pit.
There were no light to be seen, no way of climbing out.

To the princess, life wasn't much easier.
Her hope and dream were shattered.
She was walking blind in a dark tunnel.

They found each others again.
The pig thought that he would never meet the princess ever again.
The princess had little hope as well.
Damn, how wrong they were.
Was it fate or not? We'd never know.

The world is too big for a second coincidence like this.
I think it wasn't fate. It was them.
By nature, the entropy, which represents the level of disorder, increases.
They are not supposed to find each others again.
I think they fought back.

He thinks of himself as a rugged beast.
With what he has gone through, little in life can scar him anymore.
Yet, she can see through his scarred skin and find the little pig.
The princess can easily level him with her eyes.
Little in life can hurt him, but a single drop of her tear would.
