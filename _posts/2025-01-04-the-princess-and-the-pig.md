## Chapter 1. The Kids

Once upon a time, there was a little pig.
The little pig was blessed and _**cursed**_ by his own parents: to inherit their powers, but also their shortcoming.
His parents work hard to provide him and his sister with food.
But the price for food is that, his parents aren't around.
Little pig has many close friends and relatives besides him.
They take him in, play with him, take care of him.
But when the sun goes down, his friends and relatives go back to their home.
The pig must go back to his house. But his doesn't feel like a home.

Little pig doesn't really know what it's like to love someone or to be loved.
He watches people around him falling in love, taking care of others, but also hurting others in the name of love and falling out of love.
He has a bit of knowledge here and there about how to take care of himself and others.
However, he wasn't really taught properly how to receive love and how to love himself and others.

As the pig grows older, one day, he leave everything behind, his old house, close friends and families, and goes out into the world.
Along the way, he makes new friends, who teach him invaluable lessons about life.
One lesson is a sad truth about life : friends come and go.
Throughout his life, people has come and gone, just like his parents.
He soon realizes that he himself also comes in and goes out of other's lives.
Like it or not, it's just the nature of life.
It's sad sometimes, to realize [_"how easy it is in life to part ways with people forever"_](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=how+easy+it+is+in+life+to+part+ways+with+people+forever).
No matter how meaningful [these small hours, these little wonders](https://youtu.be/q6wZhd8M848?si=wcmVIaEgzVBqPIh-) are, they already start to fade away.

On another side of the world, there was an adorable little princess.
The small kingdom has faced many natural disasters.
However the king and queen gave their children the best of what they can and taught them all that they know about life.
Time flies and under the nurture of her parents, the princess grows up and becomes a beautiful, smart, kind, and brave lady.

## Chapter 2. The Coincidences

> Coincidence is a remarkable concurrence of events or circumstances that have no apparent causal connection with one another. - Wikipedia :)

Once a while, fate has brought about a rare coincidence: their lives crossed path on a summer day.

They met while their hearts were full of scars.

Something unusual, warm, and bright sparks up that day.
Their threads of life entangle for a while.
One was ready, one was not.
Fate deems it so, that they will not walk side by side then.

Life hasn't been easy to both of them.
Life pushes them down.
There were times that the pig felt like he was sitting in a dark, bottomless pit.
There were no light to be seen, no way of climbing out.

To the princess, life wasn't much easier.
Her hope and dream were shattered.
She was walking blind in a dark tunnel.

To her, he was the light in the end of the tunnel.
Little does she know, to him, she was the light shining from up high.

Neither the pig or the princess thought that they would ever meet the other again.
Yet, somehow, they manage to find the other.
Was it fate or not? We'd never know.
The world is too big for such a second coincidence like this.
I think it wasn't fate. It was them.
I think they fought back against the entropy.

## Chapter 3. The Break

He thinks of himself as a rugged beast.
With what he has gone through, little in life can scar him anymore.
Yet, she can see through his scarred skin and find the little pig.
The princess can easily level him with her eyes.
Little in life can hurt him, but a single drop of her tear would.

Damn, how wrong they were

## Chapter 4. ??

Is that it? Or would there be a next chapter? \
We just have to â€¦ wait and to have some faith.

Damn, it would be naive to believe that: \
When Two Souls Are Destined To Be Together, They Will Always Find Their Way Back.

But what else can one does?
