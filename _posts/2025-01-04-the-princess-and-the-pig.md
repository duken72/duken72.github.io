**_Spoiler alert:_** no happy ending here.

## Chapter 1. The Kids

Once upon a time, there was a little pig.
The little pig was blessed and _**cursed**_ by his own parents:
to inherit their powers, but also their shortcomings.
His parents toiled from sunrise to sunset, working tirelessly to provide him and his sister with food and shelter. Yet, the price for their sacrifice was steep. The warmth of their presence, the sound of their laughter—these were rare treasures in the little pig's life, locked away by the world.

The little pig was not alone.
Many close friends and kind-hearted relatives surrounded him.
They welcomed him with open arms, played with him, and showered him with care.
In their presence, the world felt soft and bright.
But as the sun went down, they would return to their own homes, filled with their own warmth and light.
The little pig would find himself back at his house—a house that didn't felt like a home.

At night, as he lay beneath the cold and silent stars, he wondered:
"What does it take for a house to feel like home?
Is it love? Laughter? A kind word spoken in the quiet?"

The little pig did not yet know the answers then, but in his heart, a small ember burned.
Perhaps one day, he would learn to kindle it into a fire that could warm even the emptiest of spaces.
The little pig was waiting for the day when the blessings of his parents would bloom brighter than the shadows of their curse.

On another side of the world, an adorable little princess born to a humble yet resilient kingdom.
Though the land had faced countless floods, storms, and droughts, the kingdom stood strong, led by the wise and compassionate king and queen.
Despite the challenges, the family never wavered in their love and devotion.
The king and queen worked tirelessly to give their children the best of what they could offer,
shielding them from the harshness of the world whenever possible.
They filled the princess’s days with lessons not only of duty but of kindness, resilience, and the beauty of the world even in its imperfections.

As time passed, the little princess grew under her parents’ careful nurture.
She blossomed into a young woman of rare grace and strength.
Her beauty was undeniable, but it was her heart that shone the brightest.
She was smart enough to solve the trickiest of puzzles,
kind enough to bring light to even the darkest corners of her kingdom,
and brave enough to stand tall when others faltered.

Deep inside, the princess carried a quiet yearning.
Though her days were filled with purpose and her life surrounded by love,
she often found herself gazing beyond the borders of her small kingdom.
She wondered what lay beyond the far-off hills and across the great seas.
She dreamed of discovering the unknown, learning lessons beyond the edge of her kingdom.
She whispered to herself, “Perhaps the world is bigger than I can imagine.
Perhaps there’s a part of me waiting to be found out there.”

Little did they know that their journeys would soon begin, setting them on a path that would change their lives.

## Chapter 2. The Coincidences

Coincidence is a remarkable weaving of threads, a chance meeting of lives with no clear reason or rhyme—an inexplicable magic of the world.

Once in a great while, fate weaves such a rare coincidence: the paths of a little pig and a princess crossed on a golden summer day.
Their hearts, though heavy with scars, found something in each other that was warm and bright.
That day, as if by enchantment, time stood still, and even the rain, weary of its endless fall, paused to watch.
For a moment, the burdens of life lifted, and they felt whole.

However, their time together was fleeting.
The threads of their lives unraveled as quickly as they had tangled.
One was ready, the other was not.
Fate, in its quiet wisdom or cruel whim, decreed that they would not walk side by side just then.

---

Life had been unkind to them both.
The pig found himself sitting in a dark, bottomless pit, with no light to guide him, no ladder to climb out.
Hope felt like a memory from another life.
The princess’s journey was no gentler.
Her dreams had shattered like fragile glass, and she wandered blindly through a dark tunnel, uncertain if she would ever see the light again.

Neither the pig nor the princess believed they would ever meet again.
The world was vast, and the chances of another such crossing seemed impossible.
Yet somehow, against all reasons and odds, they found each other once more.
Was it fate? Perhaps not. For in truth, it was their own doing.
They defied the entropy of the universe, reaching for one another against the currents of life.

On the coldest, darkest of days, when all hope seemed lost, they lifted their weary heads—and there they were, standing before each other once more.
To the princess, the pig was the light at the end of her long and dark tunnel.
[Little did she know](https://youtu.be/SCRapCVtJi0?si=eWG5Ul4HukhV7NOQ), to the pig, she was too [the light of his life](https://youtu.be/HpQcw1JIsO4?si=3EuNzIWnEc2hYiv0).

![the second coincidence]({{ site.url }}/assets/the-princess-and-the-pig/the-princess-meet-the-pig.png#center){:style="width:720px"}

The little pig was no longer little.
Time and hardship had turned him into a rugged beast.
His once-soft skin now scarred and weathered.
He was no longer the old innocent, adorable pig of his youth.
But the princess, with her kind and knowing heart, looked past his scars and saw the little pig who had once been.

She took one step toward him. \
He roared, warning her to keep her distance. \
She took another step. \
He roared louder, his voice trembling with fear and terror. \
But the princess was unshaken. \
With a smile as bright as the dawn, she ran to him, closing the gap between them. \
She wrapped her arms around him, holding him tightly. \
Her warmth melted the walls he had built around his heart.

At that very moment, the beast faded away, and the little pig he thought he had lost forever returned.
And so, the princess and the pig stood together, two hearts mended by the courage to face their scars, and the love that had quietly endured all along.

## Chapter 3. The Tragic Irony

From the very beginning, their tale was touched by a cruel irony, the kind that only fate can weave.
Though their paths seemed destined to cross, fate had planted an evil seed deep within the soil of their story—one that would grow into pain.

---

With the princess by his side, the pig felt invincible and had [nothing to fear](https://youtu.be/BZsXcc_tC-o?si=i2Icc5RQ-Q4WNEjq).
She [raised him up to more than he could be](https://youtu.be/wEpeTyazaKI?si=MLUs67jbBnIRb-4h),
filling the cracks in his heart with her love.

---

[When they know they're your heart, and you know you are their armor. \
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her. \
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you? \
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you? \
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?](https://youtu.be/1wYNFfgrXTI?si=Py6caqLrV_mPTtCb)

The pig, who had spent his life observing love from the outside, never truly learned how to hold it in his hands.
He had seen the way people cared for one another, but also how love could wound and unravel.
He had learned bits and pieces about caring for others, but he had never been taught how to receive love, nor how to truly love himself.

In his fight against the world, he didn’t notice when he stopped holding the princess’s hands.
In his endless roaring in the darkness, he failed to see that he had left her standing in the cold, sad, and lonely.

The princess, brave as ever, opened her arms and let him into her heart, but he didn’t know how to be gentle.
Time and time again, without meaning to, he scratched her heart, leaving wounds that she carried in silence.

---

When the pig finally turned around to face her, it was too late.
She was crying.
The pig, who had endured so much pain that little in life could scar him, found himself undone by her tears.
Each drop that fell was like a thousand cuts, carving into his heart.

They stood there in front of the others. \
One was crying, exhausted, and feeling hopeless. \
One was watching, frozen, and feeling clueless.

---

The pig remembered one painful truth he had learned on his journey: friends come and go.
It's sad sometimes, to realize [_"how easy it is in life to part ways with people forever"_](https://www.tvfanatic.com/tv-characters-who-rock-the-dance-floor/).
People, no matter how deeply they touch our lives, often drift away, just as his parents had, just as so many others had before. \
And now, he saw the same truth unfolding before him once more. \
The pig, still scarred by the lessons of his life, believed they could fight fate. \
He wanted to keep on fighting. \
He was ready to roar against the world once more.

But she was not. The princess had given everything she had.
She had fought alongside him, carried him through his darkest days, and held on for as long as she could. \
But she was then exhausted. [Lonely](https://youtu.be/NbF1vhBppKQ?si=TIVcq8uLMkD2zc9U). Hurt. \
[Where do you go when love it just ain't enough?](https://youtu.be/iYdVT-ODiKI?si=GNYPQNOx6vYiRC56) \
Her brave and kind heart, which had once leaped forward to touch him, now made another hard decision. \
With tears in her eyes, the princess chose to leave.

## Chapter 4. The Unknown

And so, as the threads of their lives unraveled once again, the pig stood in silence, [watching as the princess walked away](https://youtu.be/s28-H2pe58Y?si=Wx7BstiONipYkK66).
Her figure grew smaller and smaller, until she disappeared into the distance.
They had given up the fight, not out of defeat, but out of acceptance.
Some battles are not meant to be won. Some threads are meant to unravel.
The princess and the pig set forth on their separate journeys into the vast unknown, seeking the pieces of themselves they had yet to find.
Their [lonely](https://youtu.be/XBMawS-CGgE?si=8Iq76kOnTzhzjOOt) hearts, etched with scars, carried the weight of pain—but also a quiet, fragile hope.

It was a moment he would carry forever, like all the [little wonders](https://youtu.be/q6wZhd8M848?si=wcmVIaEgzVBqPIh-) and fleeting hours that had already started to fade.
And though the pig would walk forward into a new chapter of his life, he would never forget the princess who had once run toward him with a fearless smile and melted the beast inside.
For love, though it can wound, always leaves a mark—and hers would stay with him, forever.

No one could say if fate would one day weave their paths together again, returning to them what had been lost.
The future was as mysterious as the stars above, and the answers lay hidden in the folds of time.
In the end, all they could do was wait—wait, and trust.
Trust in the whispers of the wind, the pull of the stars, and the gentle tides of the universe.
Perhaps it was naive to believe the old saying: "When two souls are destined to be together, they will always find their way back to one another."

But belief, no matter how fragile, is often all we have to carry us forward.
And so, beneath a lonely sky painted with endless possibilities, the princess and the pig moved onward—step by step, heart by heart.
With every step, they carried the faint glimmer of faith, like a flickering lantern in the darkness.
For what else, in all the world, can one do but to hope and to move forward?

Which song would they play at the end, when they think of each other?
