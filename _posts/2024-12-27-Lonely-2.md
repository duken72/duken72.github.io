… \
This changed me is a stranger to myself as well …

I don’t know I don’t know \
Why I am like this \
We were so in love, and you’re here now but oh \
I don’t know \
I want to find myself now

Baby I’m sorry, even when I’m with you, I’m Lonely \
I must be lacking when it comes to love, please forgive this person horrible person I am \
I’m sorry, this is your and my story

… \
It seems I’ve already been prepared long ago, for our breakup \
I really wanted to treat you well, out of all the times, why is it when I’m confronted by love \
I am shrinking away & am lonely endlessly \
… \
We were so in love, and you’re here now but oh \
I don’t know \
I want to find myself now

… \
Cuz I’m just another girl \
This night is lonely, I \
Can’t take any more, Goodbye \
Cuz I’m just another girl
