Dad ... why are we just standing in the rain?

Because it's our duty son.

Why is it our duty?

Because we're ducks and it's what we do.

Why is it what we do?

I don't know son. I don't know.

But why dad?

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHAHAH.\
To appease the duck gods.
