If only you could see the tears \
In the world you left behind \
**_If only you could heal my heart \
Just one more time \
Even when I close my eyes \
There's an image of your face \
And once again I come to realize \
You're a loss I can't replace_**

Soledad \
It's a keeping for the lonely \
Since the day that you were gone \
Why did you leave me \
Soledad? \
In my heart you were the only \
And your memory lives on \
Why did you leave me \
Soledad?

Walking down the streets of Nothingville \
Where our love was young and free \
Can't believe just what an empty place \
It has come to be \
I would give my life away \
If it could only be the same \
'Cause I can't still the voice inside of me \
That is calling out your name (Calling out your name) …

Time will never change the things you've told me \
After all we're meant to be \
Love will bring us back to you and me \
**_If only you could see …_**
