I'm just a little bit caught in the middle \
Life is a maze and love is a riddle \
I don't know where to go, can't do it alone, I've tried \
And I don't know why

Slow it down, make it stop \
Or else my heart is going to pop \
'Cause it's too much, yeah, it's a lot \
To be something I'm not \
I'm a fool out of love \
'Cause I just can't get enough

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle \
Life is a maze and love is a riddle \
I don't know where to go, can't do it alone, I've tried \
And I don't know why \
I am just a little girl lost in the moment \
I'm so scared, but I don't show it \
I can't figure it out \
It's bringing me down, I know \
I've got to let it go \
And just enjoy the show \
â€¦
