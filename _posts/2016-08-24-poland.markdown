Short introduction, so I was asked to submit one story with around 200-600 words ..

dear, I have a fecking diary :3 it’s a long .. diary .. I wrote when I’m abroad: how excited I am the first day when I breathed in the air, when I saw the street, saw the trees, and of course, the human-kinds in Warsaw, even the public toilet, the trash can, the bus, the tram, … well you get the point.

Everything is intriguing to me, how I was mind-fucked the third day, how the first day at work went, start making a list of stupid, crazy new things which I did with my crazy yet adventurous new friends, then the list of things, places that I have been, that I have seen, list down new things that I had realized, until the very end, when I listed down the names of all my friends, all the little kids I managed to hug and dragging them down the dining room, because I’m afraid I will forget their name someday, somehow, and I don’t want to, and how I lost myself for a few days after I got back to Vietnam.

Anywho, don’t ask me to show you pictures of Poland, Berlin or Oslo and describe it to you cause I don’t want to, when you can easily find it on the internet, and .. secondly, I’m not that good of a photographer and I’m really suck at literature ;)

## Anyway .. to the main point..

I cannot taste the Polish tradition food for you or show you pictures, I cannot describe the feeling when you breathe in the fresh air or feel the sunlight shining down your skin, I cannot tell you how it feels like when you can sense the beating heart of a kid when she hugging your hand so tight into her chest..

There are scenes that no camera can capture, taste and feeling that no words can describe.

The world out there is beautiful, not perfect, but interesting, no, exciting.
All the fun is out there when you are sitting down here. If you really want to know, seriously if you really really want to see the world, let me tell you something

#### There are simply places that you just have to be
#### things that you just have to do
#### BY YOURSELF.

Sooooooo .. i'm back to Warsaw today ..

went to places that I had visited ..
stood on paths that I had walked by ..

funny .. how things seem unchanged..
but nothing is the same as before..
neither you nor the people you used to know ..

In the movie "Meet the Robinsons", keep moving forward .. just keep moving forward
but it also mean that you have to leave sth behind, could be bad, could be good ..
