#### This would be the part, where I'll tell you too much about meh
-----

I feel blessed to be born as a son of an engineer and a lecturer. A na√Øve belief, that a kind of mathematics and physics blood running in my vein has long been the perfect explanation, why all the principles and patterns of physics always fill my mind with wonders.

On the other hand, my love for art also arise as I used to spend whole day drafting mini paper robot design, folding, gluing, and even later, as I practice with the piano until my fingers are too numb to continue. For the majority, it is not straight-forward to see much relevance between science and art, a scientist would be someone who keeps his feet on the ground, while an artist would let his mind on the clouds.

Well, Despite that thin line of connection, I wish to choose not one, but both to pursue, as the intersection between the two is my forte, where geometry, physics, mechanical structure design, and of course, robotics lay. Through my time spending studying in these areas, it becomes crystal-clear that the ability to have a vivid imagination has started to become the key element which help me identifying my strengths, things that I could, believe and truly want to excel in.
