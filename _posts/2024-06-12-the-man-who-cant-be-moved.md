Going back to the corner where I first saw you

Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move

Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand

Saying, "If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?"

Some try to hand me money, they don't understand

I'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man

I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?

And how can I move on when I'm still in love with you?

---

Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me

And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be

Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet

And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street

People talk about the guy who's waiting on a girl, oh

There are no holes in his shoes, but a big hole in his world, mmm
