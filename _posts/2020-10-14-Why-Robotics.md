### This would be the part ..
### where I'd tell you meh long story

btw.. I'll use .. speaking language for god sake ;)  it's a blog anyway, let's not be so dramatic
-------
so.. where should we even begin

### let's rewind a bit..
### once upon a time..
when i was young, as a kid, I feel.. kinda blessed .. to be born as a son of an engineer and a lecturer in computer science.

I remember me having these science books for kids, then just running up-and-down the house, sitting on the terrace at noon, with the scorching heat from the sun.. okay that was a bit over-exaggerated, but it was hot sunny day, for a kid, okay.. anywho, with a magnifying glass, i was so excited burning all the dry leaves, and box.. no, boxes of matches

gotta say, those days, i was not so much of an environment-friendly kid.. i enjoyed watching things being burned :)

A strong, yet.. naïve belief, which I used to have, that a kind of mathematics and physics blood running in my vein.. has long been the perfect justification for me, why all the principles and patterns of how the world works always fill my mind with wonders.. and that.. the whole world will soon in the grasp of my tiny hands.

well, with that in mind, addition to the surrounding assistance, I have stayed persistently curious and diligent when it comes to studying mathematics and science subjects.

### However.. there is always a however
Without a forehand warning, reality gradually, but.. unhesitantly  enlightens me with all the limitations, and of course, challenges, from not only within myself, but from the world that I used to view with my ingenuous eyes.
-------
### On the other hand, I like **Art**
> .. okay who doesn't  -.-

to me, almost everything, that is artistic, aesthetic, appeals me immensely. I'd say that I enjoy so many fields of art, not just the basics like drawing, music, photography, dancing, but also architecture, cooking, writing, carving sculpture ..

but.. I don't want to always be just one among the crowd.. a spectator, an audience of others work from far distance..

I also want to be the one making, creating things.. and yeah all the showing and bragging about them :P

During all these times, coming out of blindsight, initially as a simple.. distraction.. from daily tensions, it brought me peaceful joy.

There were times I found myself spending days drawing stupid stuffs, folding origami. I used to have a 3-drawer cabinet sitting by my studying desk. One of the drawer was just full of my origami, and it was not like that piece of cake paper crane, no no no, that was child's play, mine was full with.. intricate works my dear friends, i'm talking about mammals, dinosaurs, dragons..

but yeah then on a sunny bright day, who would have expected his parents deciding to throw them all away :(

At later stage, I still find myself drafting mini paper robot designs, folding, gluing, and even later, as I practice with the piano until my fingers are too numb to continue.

The.. love.. I have for art.. is not by social preference, actually against parents hope, as you can see above.

### To me, it is pure, for the sake of art itself, and nothing more.
Regardless of the excuses, the more time and effort I spend, not only the better the outcomes, but also the greater the influence they have on me.
>This might sounds a bit stupid .. but uhm..

### playing piano teaches me to be more patient, to be perseverant
I always have to go from simple stuffs, step by step, section by section.
There were songs that I have to practice in months, half a year.. yet.. I finished them.

### origami teaches me to be extremely detail-oriented.
The mistakes you make on the earlier folds, they will keep stacking up to your shitty final results :)

### these traits that I got, I could always bring to other disciplines.
it's just pretty much the same while you coding, debugging that you need to be patient, to pay attention to details..

also drawing helps my imagination, 3D perception, but let's just skip that for now
------
  okay.. quite long already, and a bit all over the place!!
  so what is the point here??

### For the majority, it is not straight-forward to see.. much, if any
### relevance between doing engineering and doing art

An engineer would be someone who keeps his feet on the ground, spends his/her day working in factory or office, dealing, operating with electrical, mechanical stuffs, coding, supervising, being stiff, but reliable, accountable..

while an artist seems like someone who would let his mind on the clouds.. spontaneous, peculiar, sensitive, speak and hear in colour..

Well, despite that thin line of connection, I wish to choose not one, but both to pursue, as the intersection between the two is my forte, where geometry, physics, and of course, **ROBOTICS** lay.

With everything I got from both sides, this field is where I could, believe and truly want to excel in.
-------
Those old days are far behind, and Iron Man’s suits are not made of paper and glue. What, initially is a child’s toy, are now a young student’s desire for feasible application in real life and the industry. With that preferences, my last-year work have been vigorously appealing, yet constantly arduous and unforgettable as I took the challenge alone to design and conduct 3D simulation for a robotics control system. The final simulation was completed only 2 weeks in prior to the final presentation, with countless times that I stumbling with things I never knew before, times that I feel like meeting dead-end only to pick myself up and find the way around. Continuing day after day till the end, in term of knowledge, I have learnt so much, but also gain more awareness of what I haven’t knew yet that could be learnt. Outside of knowledge, I have learnt to persevere, to pick myself up after every falls, and look for solution. And the biggest one: is learning to force yourself to do things that you do not like, just because they are necessary for you to pursue things that you love. Not all aspects of robotics are lucid and interesting, but there are more to like in the field, enough to struggle through all others.

gotta say .. for you to reach this end ..
either having some serious perseverance and determination
or you're' having an absolutely lazy-ass unproductive day my friend, shame on you!!
#### still .. thanks for spending your time reading this!!
#### Appreciate.. and respect!!
