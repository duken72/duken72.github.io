I really hope that you got here from my LinkedIn profile.

If not, you can always go there through the LinkedIn button on the Menu.

It would be a lie to say that this blog was created mostly for fun, and sharing with my friends.
This is for you guys, from the very beginning.

My personality type is INFJ, I'm not the kind of people who extremely enjoy making brand new connections with others.
Thus, for me to do this, you could obviously sense my desperation .. or determination to find an internship, and later on, an open job position.
