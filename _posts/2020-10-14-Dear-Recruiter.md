##### ***Dear,***

It would be a lie to say that this blog was created mainly for fun or sharing stuffs with my friends.

**This is for you guys, from the very beginning.**

I really hope that you got here from my LinkedIn profile.
If not, you can always go there through the LinkedIn button on the Menu.

I'm a master student majoring in Robotic Systems Engineering, at RWTH Aachen University. For the last semester of my study, I have to conduct a compulsory internship and write my final thesis. Thus, ideally, I am looking for robotic project in which I can work as intern and write my thesis at the same time. In addition, I wish to gain more experience working in the field of robotics after my graduation as well.

Don't you know, my personality type is INFJ, I'm not the kind of people who extremely enjoy making brand new connections with others.
Thus, for me.. to do this, you could see my **determination**.. and also a bit of desperation to find an internship, and later on, an open job position.
My detail profile, CV, transcript, everything are available on LinkedIn. This blog is created with a hope for you guys to know me more in person.

Mainly ***[this one](https://duken72.github.io/2020/Why-Robotics/)***  is about why I chose the field.

I hope you have a good time here.
If you have more time, or perhaps out of curiosity, feel free to check other posts, hope you enjoy them.
If you like them, my posts, my stories, it would be great to subscribe, share with other colleagues, feel free to do so!!

Thank you for your time, for reading this.
Feel free to reach out for me if needed!

Wish you a great day!!

##### ***Best regards,***
