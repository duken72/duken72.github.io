Baby I’m sorry I’m so lonely

hey darling

just tell me the reason

suddenly why you stop falling for me

it hurts when you leave

heard enough sorry

was it because i cannot show you all i’ve promised

my heart is bleeding

oh please

just give me one chance

to make you understand

i love you the most

all the bad things that make you despair

i’m taking control

i won’t let you down this time

everything will be different

baby kiss me one more time when i’m alone

you know that just like what you used to do before

baby send me you location

don’t leave me with no reason

Baby I’m sorry I’m so lonely

Baby I’m sorry I’m so lonely

you told me to find another lover

you know i can’t

cause you have lived deep in my blood

want to calm down

try my best to turn my body around

but till this moment i don’t know
