… But then one day, she can't take it no more and decide to leave

Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night \
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side \
Coulda sworn I was dreamin' for her \
I was feenin' so I had to take a little ride \
Backtracking over these few years \
Tryin' ta figure out what I do to make it go bad \
'Cause ever since my girl left me \
My whole life came crashing and I'm so lonely …

Can't believe I had a girl like you \
And I just let you walk right outta my life \
After all I put you through \
You still stuck around and stayed by my side \
What really hurt me is I broke your heart \
Baby, you're a good girl and I had no right \
I really wanna make things right \
'Cause without you in my life girl, I'm so lonely …

Been all about the world, ain't never met a girl \
That can take the things that you been through \
Never thought the day would come where you'd get up and run \
And I would be out chasing you \
'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be \
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see \
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely …

Never thought that I'd be alone \
I didn't think you'd be gone this long \
I just want you to call my phone \
So stop playing girl and come on home \
Baby girl, I didn't mean to shout \
I want me and you to work it out \
I never wished to ever hurt my baby \
And it's drivin' me crazy 'cause I'm so lonely …
